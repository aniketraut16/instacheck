# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the InstaCheck project pledge to make participation in our community a welcoming, friendly, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- Showing kindness and empathy towards other contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Insulting, derogatory, or demeaning comments/trolling
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other's private information (e.g. names, emails) without explicit permission
- Discriminatory jokes, language, or imagery

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, or ban temporarily or permanently any contributor whose behavior is inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—including GitHub issues, pull requests, Discord/Slack chat rooms, and direct messages—as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at [rautnaniket@gmail.com](mailto:rautnaniket@gmail.com) or by opening a confidential GitHub issue.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html
